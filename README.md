# Proposal from March

_either keep in full or move to new file_

_note any changes from the original proposal clearly (e.g., **new:** I will add one level.  ~~I will add two levels.~~)

## Brief Overview of game 

_no more than 300 words_

## Must Have Features

_include 2 or more new features that constitute significant extensions on the base project that you will prioritise the implementation of_.

i managed to make the 2 Extensions and them mostly working but had to scale back dew to the scale of it back im happy with what i made 1. an ai helper who follows u and kills enemies and 2 an increase in difficulty in the second part where time is shorter and points are much higher


note, we will be expecting all of these to be included, in some form, in the final submission.

i was not able to add the boss expansion due to time constraints, but i was able to add an extra level
_include 2 or more new features that constitute significant extensions on the base project that you will probably implement_.

i never got around to adding them into the game due to time constraints but I did manage to add a new forest level with new enemy trees that hurt you if you walk into them so you need to watch the kick back on your shotgun

## Could Have Features

_include 2 or more new features that constitute significant extensions on the base project that you may implement_.

again i couldn't make those features because of the time constraints but i would have loved to implement them

## Wish to Have Features

_include 2 or more new features that constitute significant extensions on the base project that you will not implement unless all others are included_.

again i couldn't make those features because of the time constraints but i would have loved to implement them
